### Cloner.app

Simple OS X app to allow cloning github repositories via a bookmarklet or dragging and dropping a URL to the dock icon.

For bookmarklet, see [bookmarklet.html](https://github.com/bricooke/cloner-app/blob/master/bookmarklet.html)

### TODO
* Commission an icon and possibly a proper website.
* Add support for prompting for username/password for protected URLs
